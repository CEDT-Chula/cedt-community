## Contribution Guidelines
### Code Of Conduct
- Respect the design system and conventions used in the project.
- Respect the design references and guidelines provided by the design team.
### Contributing
#### Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (Direct commits to the main branch will be rejected).
- If testing branch is available, PR to that branch (maintainers will merge it to the main branch after testing).
- Make sure to follow the coding style and conventions used in the project.
- Make sure to test your code before creating a pull request (ensure it Builds and Runs without errors).
- Create a pull request with a clear description of the changes you made.
- Make sure to follow the commit message guidelines.
#### Issues
- If you find a bug or have a feature request, create an issue in the repository.
- Make sure to provide a clear description of the issue or feature request.
- Make sure to provide steps to reproduce the bug or steps to implement the feature.
- If possible please provide references or examples to help the maintainers understand the issue or feature request.
### Commit Messages
- We're not strict with the message but please use conventional commits as much as possible. such as `feat: add new feature`, `fix: fix a bug`, `chore: update dependencies`, etc.
- Please use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature") and use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...").
- DO NOT use emojis in commit messages ðŸ˜±.
### Design System
The website uses the NextUI design system, which is a set of components and utilities built on top of Tailwind CSS.
#### Components
- Avoid reinventing the wheel, use the components and utilities provided by NextUI as much as possible.
- If you need to create a new component, make sure it's not already available in NextUI.
#### Theme and Colour Scheme
- Always use the theme and colour scheme provided by NextUI.
- If custom colours are needed, add them to the `tailwind.config.js` file. such as `primary`, `secondary`, `accent`, etc.
- Avoid using custom colours in components, use the theme colours as much as possible. since reusing the theme colours makes the website more consistent and easier to maintain.
